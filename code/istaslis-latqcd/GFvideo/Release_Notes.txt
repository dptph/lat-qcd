--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II.A.   Windows Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The OpenCL applications in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require a GPU with CUDA Compute 
   Architecture to run properly. For a complete list of CUDA-Architecture compute-enabled GPUs, 
   see the list online at:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html

2. The OpenCL applications in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require version 196.80 of the NVIDIA 
   Display Driver or later to run on 32 bit or 64 bit Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7.  
   Drivers are available for download at:  http://developer.nvidia.com/object/opencl-download.html
   
   Please make sure to read the Driver Installation Hints Document before you 
   install the driver: http://www.nvidia.com/object/driver_installation_hints.html

3. Uninstall any previous versions of the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK

4. Install the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK by running the installer provided for your OS.
    
   The default installation folder for the OpenCL SDK is: 

   Windows XP
       C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL

   Windows Vista
       C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL
           
   Note: The "Application Data" and "ProgramData" folders are hidden by default on many Windows installations, but they
   can be made visible if desired by changing the settings in "Folder Options" in the "Tools" menu in the Windows File
   Explorer.
      
5. After installing the SDK, open the SDK Browser from the Start Menu by clicking on "NVIDIA GPU Computing 
   SDK Browser" in the NVIDIA GPU Computing folder within the NVIDIA Corporation program group 
   installed in the Windows Start Menu.  

      - Each installed SDK sample program is shown along with links for running the executable and 
        viewing the source code files.
 
      - Some of the samples additionally present a link to a Whitepaper describing the sample in detail.
 
      - The samples are presented within the SDK browser in approximate order of complexity,from the least 
        complex projects at the top to the most complex projects at the bottom.

6. Build the 32-bit or 64-bit (match the installation OS), release and debug  
   configurations, of the entire set of SDK projects and utility dependencies using 
   the provided oclRelease.sln solution for Microsoft Visual Studio Version 8/2005 
   (or oclRelease_vc9.sln for Microsoft Visual Studio Version 9/2008).  

   These .sln files are installed into the "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL" directory 
   of the SDK. They will build or copy all sample .exe's and relevant .libs and .dll's 
   for the present OS and place execution binaries in the proper directories within   
   "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\bin\<platform>\<configuration>" 
   
   For subsequent builds, you can either 
      - Use the individual solution files located in each of the examples' directories in 
        "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\src", or
        
      - Use the global solution files oclRelease.sln or oclRelease_vc9.sln located
        in "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL".
   
7. Build Structure Notes for the OpenCL portion of the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK:
      
      - "$(PlatformName)" is used by the Visual Studio projects in the SDK to switch to the 
        correct OpenCL.lib file version (Win32 or x64) in the "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\lib" 
        folder.  This is a stublib file needed at build time for implicit linking to the DLL file "OpenCL.dll", 
        which is installed on the system with the proper NVIDIA GPU driver.
        
      - A post-build event is executed upon build of "oclRelease.sln" (oclRelease_vc9.sln) or
        oclUtils.sln (oclUtils_vc9.sln), causing necessary dll's to be copied to the 
        directory within "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\bin\<platform>\<configuration>" 
        (the same directory containing the exe's, as also discussed in item 6 above). This puts 
        the DLL's in the first default path location searched by Windows upon execution. 

      - The samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK link statically to a utility library called 
        "shrUtils" which is a set of generic C++ utilities unrelated to OpenCL but useful for 
        making sample demonstration applications with any of the NVIDIA GPU Computing API's. 

          - Developers need not worry about shrUtils if step #6 above is executed, because this dependency 
            is taken care of in step #6. But developers may review or edit source code for shrUtils using 
            shrUtils.sln or shrUtils_vc9.sln in "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\shared\". 
        
          - The release version of SDK samples link to shrUtils[32|64].lib. The debug versions 
            of these samples link to shrUtils[32D|64D].lib .
            
          - The output of the shrUtils.sln compilation is set in project settings to go to the 
            subdirectory "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\shared\lib".
            
          - shrUtils is provided and used in this SDK for convenience only.  It is not necessary for
            independent OpenCL application development.

      - The OpenCL samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK also link statically to a utility library called 
        "oclUtils" which is a set of OpenCL related or OpenCL SDK specific utilities and also serves as a common 
        header for most standard system includes and shrUtils.
        
          - Developers need not worry about oclUtils if step #6 above is executed, because this dependency 
            is taken care of in step #6.  But developers may review or edit source code for oclUtils using 
            oclUtils is found in oclUtils.sln (oclUtils_vc9.sln) in "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\common". 

          - The release version of SDK samples link to oclUtils[32|64].lib. The debug versions 
            of these samples link to oclUtils[32D|64D].lib .

          - The output of the oclUtils compilation is set in project settings to go to
            "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\common\lib":

          - oclUtils is provided and used in this SDK for convenience only.  It is not necessary for
            independent OpenCL application development.

8. To view the as-built sample applications after executing step 6, run the examples from the release 
   or debug directories located in: "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\bin\win[32|64]\[release|debug]".

    - All of the SDK applications output messages to a console window that are of interest from the 
      standpoint of understanding basic OpenCL program flow, and several of the applications generate
      graphics output in a separate OpenGL window.  
      
    - Many of the SDK applications present some timing information useful for obtaining an 
      overall perspective of program structure and flow and the time required for setup and execution of 
      significant functions.  The SDK example code, however, has generally been simplified for instructional 
      purposes and is not optimized.  Advanced optimization techniques are beyond the scope of this SDK, and 
      any timing information presented by the samples is not intended for such usage as benchmarking.  

    - All of the applications additionally log all the console information to a session log file in the
      same directory as the executables.  Those files are named clearly after the name of the sample app, 
      but with a .txt extension.  

    - For convenience, the oclSDK.bat batch file is placed in the executable directory by a post-build event
      from build of oclRelease.sln (or oclRelease_vc9.sln).  When running this batch file, execution pauses 
      only briefly at the completion of each sample, but the log files generated by each application (as noted 
      above) may be viewed at the user's convenience after all samples have completed (a few minutes).  
      The oclSDK.bat file also creates the integrated log file "oclSDK.txt" which contains the complete 
      sequential output of all of the samples run by oclSDK.bat.


9. A syntax highlighting file for Visual Studio 8/2005 or 9/2008 has been provided with this 
   SDK in "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\doc\usertype.dat".  This file contains OpenCL API 
   data types.  Adding this file to the proper directory (or pasting its contents into any 
   pre-existing copy of this file) prior to starting Visual Studio will provide highlighting of 
   the OpenCL specific data types.  
   
   The default location for the usertype.dat file for VS 8 and VS 9 on 32 bit Windows is
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE  or
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9\Common7\IDE  

   The default location for the usertype.dat file for VS 8 and VS 9 on 64 bit Windows is
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE  or
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9\Common7\IDE     

   See chapter 4 of the NVIDIA OpenCL Getting Started Guide for Windows for more information.

II.B.   Linux Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The OpenCL SDK samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require a GPU with CUDA Compute 
     Architecture to run properly. For a complete list of CUDA-Architecture compute-enabled GPUs, 
     see the list online at:  http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html

2. The OpenCL SDK samples in the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK require version 195.36.08 of the NVIDIA 
   Display Driver or later to run on 32 bit or 64 bit Linux. Drivers are available for download 
   at:  http://developer.nvidia.com/object/opencl-download.html 
   
   Please make sure to read the Driver Installation Hints Document before you 
   install the driver: http://www.nvidia.com/object/driver_installation_hints.html

3. Uninstall any previous versions of the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK

4. Install the NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK by running the installer provided for your OS.
             
   The default installation folder for the OpenCL SDK is: 

     Linux
           $(HOME)/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/  
           
     In the following we will refer to the path that the SDK is installed into as <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>.    
     
5. Build the 32-bit or 64-bit (match the installation OS), release and debug  
   configurations, of the entire set of SDK projects and utility dependencies.
   a. Go to <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>/OpenCL
   b. Build:
    - release configuration by typing "make".
    - debug   configuration by typing "make dbg=1".

   Running make at the top level first builds the shared and common util libraries used by
   the SDK samples (these libraries are simply for convenience and are not part of the OpenCL
   distribution and are not required for your own OpenCL programs). Make then builds each
   of the projects in the SDK.    

6. Run the examples from the release or debug directory located in 
   <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>/OpenCL/bin/linux/[release|debug].

    - Most of the SDK applications output messages to a console window that are of interest from the 
      standpoint of understanding basic OpenCL program flow, and several of the applications generate
      graphics output in a separate OpenGL window.  
      
    - Many of the SDK applications present some timing information useful for obtaining an 
      overall perspective of program structure and flow and the time required for setup and execution of 
      significant functions.  The SDK example code, however, has generally been simplified for instructional 
      purposes and is not optimized.  Advanced optimization techniques are beyond the scope of this SDK, and 
      any timing information presented by the samples is not intended for such usage as benchmarking.  

    - All of the applications additionally log all the console information to a session log file in the
      same directory as the executables.  Those files are named clearly after the name of the sample app, 
      but with a .txt extension.

    - For convenience, the Makefile in <NV_COMPUTE_SDK_PATH>/OpenCL can be used to execute all 
      SDK samples sequentially by typing "make runall" or "make dbg=1 runall".

III.A.  Creating a new OpenCL Program in Windows using the SDK infrastructure 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a new OpenCL Program using the NVIDIA OpenCL SDK infrastructure is easy.
Just follow these steps:

1. Copy one of the installed OpenCL SDK project folders, in it's entirety, into 
   "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\src" and then rename the folder. Now you have 
   something like "\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\src\<myproject>"

2. Edit the filenames of the project to suit your needs.

3. Edit the *.sln, *.vcproj and source files. Just search and replace all
   occurrences of the old filenames to the new ones you chose.

4. Build the 32-bit and/or 64-bit, release and debug
   configurations using <myproject>.sln or <myproject>_vc9.sln.

5. Run <myproject>.exe from the release or debug, directories located in
   "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\bin\win[32|64]\[release|debug]".

6. Modify the code to perform the computation you require. See the OpenCL
   Programming Guide, the OpenCL API Specifications, and the OpenCL Best Practices Guide
   for details of programming in OpenCL.

IV.A. Creating a new OpenCL Program in Windows outside of the SDK infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a new OpenCL Program without using the NVIDIA OpenCL SDK infrastructure, a few 
key files are important to find and utilize.

1. The only OpenCL-specific files needed to build an application to run with NVIDIA
   compute-capable GPU's with CUDA architecture on a system with a supported OS using
   recommended NVIDIA Display drivers supporting OpenCL, are:

   - Headers:
        cl.h
        cl_platform.h        
        cl_ext.h
        cl_gl.h
        cl_gl_ext.h
        cl_d3d11_ext.h
        cl_d3d10_ext.h
        cl_d3d9_ext.h
        opencl.h
        
        These files are located in "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\common\inc\CL"

   - Stub Lib
        OpenCL.lib (different file for Win32 and x64 platforms)

        This .lib files are for build-time implicit linking to the OpenCL driver/compiler, 
        OpenCL.dll, and they are located in: 
        
        "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\common\lib\[Win32|x64] 
            
        Note: These lib files are not needed for applications implementing explicit DLL linkage at run-time.

   - Dynamic Link Library:

        OpenCL.dll 
        
        This file is the binary OpenCL driver/compiler. The appropriate version of this file 
        for a target platform is installed by the correct NVIDIA GPU driver installed on the system.  
        It is needed during OpenCL program execution and is normally located in the \Windows\system32 
        directory (in the default path for the system).

        cl_gl.h
        cl_gl_ext.h
        opencl.h

        These files are located in "NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK\OpenCL\common\inc\CL"

   - Shared Library:
         libOpenCL.so

     This file for a target platform is installed by the correct NVIDIA GPU driver installed on the system.  
        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. On Mac OSX SnowLeopard (10.6) the following 3 SDK samples are not included with the OpenCL SDK package.
   These samples are not currently working on OSX SnowLeopard.  We are working to resolve these issues.
 
   -  oclFDTD3D
   -  oclQuasirandomGenerator   
   -  oclSimpleConvolution 
      
2. As of the release date for this updated SDK (Version 3.0 for R195 drivers), a mismatch with the 
   pre-existing OpenCL support on Mac OSX causes build failures.  This issue will likely be resolved soon.
   
   The SDK is using the very latest headers from Khronos published February 17, 2010, along with updated NVIDIA 
   extension headers.  But symbols for OpenCL support on Mac OSX are provided in OpenCL.framework, and the header 
   files for the revision of OpenCL currently supported on Mac OSX are distributed by Apple, Inc. 
   
	 The version mismatch mainly appears to be the lack of definition for the cl_GLuint and cl_GLenum types within 
	 the cl_gl.h file, i.e.:

	     typedef unsigned int cl_GLuint;
       typedef int cl_GLint;
	     typedef unsigned int cl_GLenum;
	 
   Information about Mac OSX support for OpenCL is available he:

VI. Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developers participating in an NDA or other early access programs should send
questions, comments, etc. to opencl@nvidia.com and must not discuss their 
experience with 3rd parties.

The official public OpenCL FAQ is available online on the NVIDIA OpenCL Forums:

VII.  Change Log (most recent changes listed first)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenCL R195 Release
* All OpenCL headers from Khronos updated
* NVIDIA OpenCL extension headers updated and 4 new ones added
	(cl_gl_ext.h, cl_d3d11_ext.h, cl_d3d10_ext.h, cl_d3d9_ext.h)
* Support for ICD, CL-GL interop and CL-D3D interop
	http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/
* Some SDK samples using both OpenGL and OpenCL have been updated to use new CL-GL interop
* Bug fixes and improvements
* Updated documentation

OpenCL R195 Update Release
* Miscellaneous SDK source code refinements in conjunction with updated/improved drivers
* Included Khronos OpenCL Specification and quick reference card updated to latest versions
* clext.h file name changed to cl_ext.h
* Enumeration names for extensions in cl_ext.h have been updated
* OpenCL.lib updated for change in OpenCL.dll (distributed separately with driver) from __cdecl to __stdcall   
* Previous NVIDIA OpenCL drivers permitted developers to assume that the NULL or default platform, 
  as passed to clCreateContext and related calls, was NVIDIA's platform. This approach is incompatible 
  with supporting multiple vendors on a single platform (it would be unclear which vendor is the default). 
  To prepare for compatibility with future multi-vendor OpenCL installations, NVIDIA’s drivers will no longer 
  honor NULL as a platform. This requires OpenCL programs to be changed explicitly enumerate the 
  available platforms and choose the appropriate vendors.  This change is reflected in the sample code
  in this SDK release.

OpenCL R190 Update Release
* OpenCL compiler/driver moved from SDK to r190 GPU driver
